## About This Repository

This repo is for me to keep practicing technical interviews since I have been lacking off for a while. I create my own solutions to various coding problems and algorithmic challenges.

Feel free to use my solutions as a way to help you understand the problems and create your own implementations!

## What You'll Find Here

### Problem Categories
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
- **System Design**: Scalability concepts and architecture patterns
- **Behavioral**: Common interview questions and preparation notes

### Solution Structure
Each problem typically includes:
- Problem statement and constraints
- My approach and thought process
- Code implementation with comments
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Alternative solutions when applicable

### Languages Used
I primarily solve problems in:
- Python (for rapid prototyping and clarity)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Familiarity with at least one programming language

### Using This Repository
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/megane18/crack_the_interview
   cd crack_the_interview
   ```

2. **Browse by topic or difficulty:**
   - Navigate to specific folders for different problem types
   - Each solution includes detailed explanations

3. **Run the solutions:**
   ```bash
   python solution.py
   ```

## My Practice Strategy

### Daily Goals
- Solve at least 1-2 problems per day
- Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions
- Practice explaining my thought process out loud
- Time myself to simulate real interview conditions

### Progress Tracking
- Keep notes on challenging problems
- Review and optimize previous solutions
- Practice problems from different companies
- Mock interviews with friends/peers

## Resources I Use

- **LeetCode**: For algorithmic problems
- **HackerRank**: For structured practice
- **Cracking the Coding Interview**: Classic preparation book
- **System Design Primer**: For system design concepts
- **Pramp/InterviewBit**: For mock interviews

## Contributing

While this is primarily my personal practice repo, I welcome:
- Suggestions for better solutions
- New problem recommendations
- Bug fixes in existing code
- Alternative approaches to problems

## Disclaimer

These are my personal solutions developed during my learning process. They may not always be the most optimal, but they represent my understanding and approach to each problem. Always strive to understand the logic and create your own solutions!
